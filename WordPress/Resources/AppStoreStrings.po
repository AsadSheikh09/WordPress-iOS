"- You’ll go from “initial signup” to “complete website” faster with a smart site-creation process that starts you off with a personalized, already-customized website. You might need to push up your launch schedule now, sorry about that! What a nice problem to have.\n"
"- Once you create your new site, there are more tutorials available than ever to help you shape and grow it, including tips on building your audience. We’ll suggest them where it makes sense, and you find them all on the My Sites screen at any time. Because launching is beginning, not an ending.\n"
"- In our ongoing quest to make the app a joy to use — or at least more pleasant — we’ve increased the padding of the editor window so typing longer posts is more comfortable, and given some error pages layouts and illustration that are more consistent with the rest of the app so they’re easier to understand.\n"
